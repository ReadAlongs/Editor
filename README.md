# ReadAlong Alignment Editor

This is a quite simple little web application that will allow the
alignments in a ReadAlong (either a standalone HTML file, or an XML
file + associated audio, or some combination of the above) to be
edited.

For the moment it does not quite work, nor does the UI behave as you'd
expect, but at least it allows you to look at the alignments!
